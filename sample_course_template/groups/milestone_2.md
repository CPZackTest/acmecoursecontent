## Group Milestone - Brainstorming

In this program, we want to ensure that each of you leaves the class with the ability to conceptualize, design and most importantly **architect your own apps from scratch**. Many engineers at larger organizations understand the mobile codebase and can fix bugs or add features to an existing app. We want to take a step back and provide you the ability to architect apps which requires an even deeper understanding of mobile and product development. 

### Generating Ideas

This lab we will focus on brainstorming app ideas in small groups as well as reviewing how to evaluate the ideas to identify the best projects to build. When brainstorming with your group, be sure to enter the top ideas into the [Project Brainstorming Site]({{ COHORT | brainstorming_url }}).

<% if current_cohort.nonprofits? %>

Note that there will also be non-profit ideas available for your team to select as well. Working on a non-profit idea can often be more challenging since your team is not the audience but also provides an opportunity to solve a real issue and potentially have your app used by the non-profit in the future. Also, we find that the most compelling product stories are often from non-profit inspired apps.

### Evaluating Ideas

When evaluating projects consider the following:

 - **Mobile:** How uniquely mobile is the product experience?
    - What makes your app more than a glorified website? 
    - Try for 2 or more of these: maps, camera, location, audio, sensors, push, real-time, etc
 - **Story:** How compelling is the story around this app once completed?
   - How clear is the value of this app to your audience?
   - How well would your friends or peers respond to this product idea?
 - **Market:** How large or unique is the market for this app?
   - What's the size and scale of your potential user base?
   - Does this app provide huge value to a niche group of people?
   - Do you have a well-defined audience of people for this app?
 - **Habit:** How habit-forming or addictive is this app?
   - How frequently would an average user open and use this app?
   - Does an average user just consume your app or do they create?
 - **Scope:** How well-formed is the scope for this app?
   - How technically challenging will it be to complete this app by the end of the program?
   - Is a stripped-down version of this app still interesting to build?
   - How clearly defined is the product you want to build?

Our goal is to infuse with you not just technical but also product knowledge. You need to be able to tell a great story to convince people of your ideas.  If you're trying to raise funding for a startup idea, you'll need to sell investors on your story.  If you're trying to recruit other engineers, you need to be able to articulate these points to convince them to join you.

Remember that you can have a great story but small market.  Try to assess the strengths of one criteria against the other ones.
