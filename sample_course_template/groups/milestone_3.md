## Group Milestone - Group Formation

This lab we will focus on beginning the process of group formation. Once groups are formed they can select any of the suggested projects or pick their own project that follows the requirements listed in the [[Group Project Overview|Group Project]]. Review the following before selecting a project with your team:

- [Project Brainstorming Site]({{ COHORT | brainstorming_url }})

<% if current_cohort.nonprofits? %>

- [Available Non-Profit Projects]({{ COHORT | nonprofit_pdf_url }})

Working on a non-profit idea can often be more challenging since your team is not the audience but also provides an opportunity to solve a real issue and potentially have your app used by the non-profit in the future. Also, we find that the most compelling product stories are often from non-profit inspired apps.

### Formation Mixer

During this lab, we will give every person a chance to chat as many other participants as possible in the following format:

  * Each engineer will be given a list of all the participants in the program. 
  * Engineers will be given an hour with the mission to briefly meet every other engineer in the room and mark them down on their list. 
  * Engineers can discuss their backgrounds / skill-sets, favorite app ideas and other key factors such as location. 
  * Keep in mind the people you'd **like to work with** as well as those that you'd prefer **not to work with**. 

At the end of the session, we will send a survey collecting you preferences and we will announce the final groups before {{ LECTURE(4) | shortdate }}.
