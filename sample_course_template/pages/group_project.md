## Course Group Project

### Overview

In addition to the mini-apps assigned each week, we will also have a collaborative course-wide project. The class will be broken up into groups of 3 students each, and every group will select a larger project to scope, design and build over the course of the 8 weeks. We will provide a list of recommended projects but also will work with each team to help them select their own project ideas if desired. At the end of the course, we will do a _demo day_ showcasing all of these projects. 

### Project Guidelines

For the group project, each team is able to select the project that they want to build for the course. However, certain requirements and guidelines for the project need to be considered in order to ensure the project will fit within the curriculum presented. Requirements of the project:

- Must have **at least** three separate "activities" or screens supporting user interaction
- Must be **data-driven** with dynamic information or media being displayed
- Must use a **RESTful API** to source the data that is populated into the application
- Must use **local persistence** either through files, preferences or SQLite

In addition to these, a few other guidelines to consider given the course material:

- Projects should **not require complex animation** or drawing (i.e games or visualizations)
- Projects should **not try to do too much** given that the project should be able to be developed in **just a few weeks**.

### Product Evaluation Criteria

When evaluating projects with your team in addition to the guidelines above, consider the following:

 - **Story:** How compelling is the story around this app once completed?
   - How clear is the value of this app to your audience?
   - How well would your friends or peers respond to this product idea?
 - **Market:** How large or unique is the market for this app?
   - What's the size and scale of your potential user base?
   - Does this app provide huge value to a niche group of people?
   - Do you have a well-defined audience of people for this app?
 - **Habit:** How habit-forming or addictive is this app?
   - How frequently would an average user open and use this app?
   - Does an average user just consume your app or do they create?
 - **Scope:** How well-formed is the scope for this app?
   - How technically challenging will it be to complete this app by the end of the program?
   - Is a stripped-down version of this app still interesting to build?
   - How clearly defined is the product you want to build?

Our goal is to infuse with you not just technical but also product knowledge too.  You need to be able to tell a great story to convince people of your ideas.  If you're trying to raise funding for a startup idea, you'll need to sell investors on your story.  If you're trying to recruit other engineers, you need to be able to articulate these points to convince them to join you.

Remember that you can have a great story but small market.  Try to assess the strengths of one criteria against the other ones.

### Project Process

During the course, instructors will meet with each team individually between each milestone to help review progress and discuss next steps for their project.

#### Design and Wireframing (Week 4)

The first step is to begin **designing** the **user interface** and **user experience** for the project based on the scope and user stories. This will involve creating **low-fidelity wireframes** that document the various screens as well as the key components and interactions that take place within the app.

Check out our [[wireframing tools]] page for more details and then pick a wireframing tool to design the UI and UX for your product. You should also be aware of the various Android [UI and UX patterns](http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/index.html).

#### Implementing (Weeks 5-7)

The final weeks will be spent **developing the app** that was planned and designed by your team. First steps include identifying the activities, models, and libraries that will be used within your Android app. What are the API endpoints? Which data models will you need? Which interactions and functions require external libraries? Next, the team will collaborate on the implementation using Git as a version control system.

Be sure to use the [discussion Q&A system](https://discussions.codepath.com) forum to ask questions and use office hours to get questions answered. Also be sure to meet up with your team and communicate effectively in order to delegate tasks. If you run into technical challenges, let us know so we can help. 

#### Demo Day (Week 8)

Each team's presentations should present with the following:

 1. **Connect.** Connect your phone or laptop to the projector as described below.
 2. **Introductions.** Introduce each team member's name right at the beginning
 3. **Pitch.** Pitch your app idea to the audience focusing on the specific problem this solves and how.
 4. **Demo.** Live demo of the core functionality of your app ideally presented as a story.
 5. **Next Steps.** Discuss next steps for your app and which features you hope to incorporate.

Remember that your presentation should be no more than 6 minutes in length. Keep your presentation short and sweet. Avoid having more than one or two presenters.  Slides are not necessary.  Focus on the live demo.

### Sample Scoping and Wireframes

We have @[[provided an example|slides/Flickr Final Project.pdf]] of the type of project that fits into scope and the associated user stories and wireframes for a @[[functional Flickr Client|slides/Flickr Final Project.pdf]]. The goal is to pick a project that has the right scope and functionality (see guidelines above) but can also be developed into a functional app within 8 weeks by your team.

### Suggested Projects

For the group project, teams can select any project they'd like but here are a few suggestions that fit the project guidelines listed above:

- Flickr client using [Flickr API](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/)
- Tumblr client using [Tumblr API](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2)
- Reddit Client using [Reddit API](http://www.reddit.com/dev/api)
- Yelp client using [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation)
- Newsreader / [RSS Feed](http://developer.yahoo.com/rss/) Reader
- Rotten Tomatoes App with their [Developer API](http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/docs)

### Group Project Q&A

> What criteria are used to for judging apps at Demo Day?

The final judging criteria is app design, technical implementation, and quality of presentation. The major focus is how well designed the UI / UX is, what features technically distinguish the app and how well presented was the demo. The judges are generally heads of mobile at various organizations that each vote on their favorite project based on the outlined criteria.

> Which winners are selected on the final Demo Day?

From the finalists for Android and iOS, one winner is chosen for best iOS app and one for Android.

> How long is each team's presentation?

Each team's presentation should take 5-7 minutes including explaining their product, slides about the details, and a live demo.

> Should one team member present or should all of them talk?

Depends. Some teams will switch off in different sections (intro is one, demo is another member). Others have one person speak the entire time.

> Is it recommended to have a slide deck prepared?

Slide deck is strongly recommended as a complement to your presentation of the product and to communicate the context for why your app is interesting.
