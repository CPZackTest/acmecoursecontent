# Grader Project Feedback Points

These are the starting templates to paste as a grader when reviewing a project. Please note that **you should be customizing these templates**. Update the phrasing based on the quality such as changing "nice work" to "excellent work" or "looks fine". Feel free to remove or change any parts of the text. These are just a starting point.

Below is also a listing of feedback points that graders should review for each project. Note that **graders should review additional aspects** but this acts as a minimum set of evaluation for each project. For each point, review the answer in a project and then give the student a point of feedback around that area based on the result.
