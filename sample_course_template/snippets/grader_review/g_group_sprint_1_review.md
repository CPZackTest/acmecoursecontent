## Group Sprint 1 Review

:+1:  Nice work creating wire-frames and creating stories for sprint 1. Great to see the basic screens and flow coming along well. Few notes to mention:

### Did they create a github repo for the group project?

**NO**

* Report the team and ask them to submit their project latest by next day.

### Did they create issues for each task, set reasonable goals and assigned to individuals to complete?

**YES**

* Well created detailed stories/tasks on the project wiki.

**NO**

* It is important create tasks for each of your stories/features and have them assigned to team members in the form of issues. Please take care of this before you work on sprint 2.

### Are bigger tasks divided into smaller subtasks?

**YES**

* Nice way of splitting a parent task into a number of smaller subtasks - provides a better picture of the progress on the issue.

**NO**

* Consider diving a bigger parent task into a number of smaller subtasks - provides a better picture of the progress on the issue.

### Is the work load equally divided among team members after completing sprint 1?

**YES**

* Good job by everyone to contribute to the project.  

**NO**

* Work load needs to be divided equally among all members of the team. This is critical in working as a team and also gives equal learning opportunity to everyone involved. Please make sure everyone contributes to the project in the next sprint.

### Are issues grouped into milestones representing sprints?

**NO**

* Group projects can reinforce skills that are relevant to both group and individual work including the ability to plan and manage time. For this reason, it is imperative that you group all detailed issues into milestones representing sprints so that its easier for you to track progress of the project.

### Did they create issue(s) to create a database schema and add models? Check the code and see if they already have Parse integrated?

**YES**

* Nice work creating and distributing tasks to create database schema and models. Good job on integrating with Parse.

**NO**

* Consider creating tasks to complete the creation of your database schema and its respective models. Also, consider integrating with Parse, if you haven't already.

### Did they create a task to document the overall strategy and design decisions?

**YES**

* Impressed that you are already thinking about documenting overall strategy and most design decisions.

**NO**

* Consider creating a project wiki so you can have a thorough documentation of all design decisions made during the project.

### Did they create task to regularly commit/merge their code?

**YES**

* Good to see that your team created regular commits to sync up your code to avoid having multiple conflicts at the end.

**NO**

* Depending on the strategy your group has come up with, consider creating regular pushes/pull-requests to sync up your code to avoid having multiple errors at the end.

### Did they create task(s) to QA their work?

**YES**

* Good job tasking to QA your work. Integration testing will especially be important for this project since each team member is working on a separate module. The best part is seeing it all come together into a polished app.

**NO**

* Consider creating tasks to QA the app a few times to check the basic flow. Integration testing will especially be important for this project since each team member is working on a separate module. The best part is seeing it all come together into a polished app.

### General note/guide on creating milestones from pull requests:

* Consider creating group [milestones/pull requests] (https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-editing-milestones-for-issues-and-pull-requests/) to better track your progress and review each others code.

Good to see the basic flow coming along well. Please take notes of these points and improve upon the same in the next sprint. Look forward to the rest of the functionality and improvement on the core flows by the end of the Sprint 2 so you can have enough time to add UI polish and advanced nice-to-have features later on. It is those little extra things you do that make everything feel more polished and desirable to use.
