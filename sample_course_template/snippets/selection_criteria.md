## CodePath Evaluation Criteria

We receive 500+ applications for every cohort and only select 24 to participate. That means that by necessity, a large number of people will not be able to participate for any given round. Still, we want people to understand how we are evaluating applicants.

This is a program designed and tailored for **experienced software engineers** interested in a highly accelerated plunge into native Android app development. Please note that this course is not appropriate for individuals with no prior professional software experience or for junior developers with less than 2 years of software experience. The success of this course largely depends on surrounding participants with peers that are all within a similar range of experience.

### Core Criteria

The requirements below are most important:

 1. Within past 3 years have been employed as a software engineer, team lead, technical founder, VPE
 1. 2+ years of professional software development experience (average participant has 5+ years)
 1. Bachelor's degree in CS/Engineering (if not then 4+ years of professional software experience)
 1. Can dedicate 10-20+ hours per week to this course
 1. Physically present in the Bay Area for each on-site session during the 8 week period
 1. Experience developing software with object-oriented programming languages
 1. Existing knowledge of Java or ability to ramp up on the language quickly

In addition, an essential element of the efficacy of this bootcamp is the agreement of each participant to the following structure and expectations:

 * **Required attendance** to all lab and lecture sessions (although we allow for one excused absence). If you miss an unexcused absence, we will ask you to withdraw from the bootcamp.
 * **Required on-time project submission** of the weekly projects. If you submit a late or incomplete project, we will ask you to withdraw from the bootcamp.
 * Interested in collaborating on a group project with a team during the course
 * Can bring a laptop with Mac OS X, Linux or Windows to each session with the required development environment setup
